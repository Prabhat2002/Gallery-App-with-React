If anyone want to see how this clock has been created,can create a simple react app and the, Go to public folder and the at 'index.html'.
Copy call the code from 'index.html' and paste in the 'index.html' file created by react app itself. 
Then back to Src folder and copy all the code of Css and js files in respective 'index.css' and 'index.js'.
And for sake of your convenience delete rest of the files of src folder instead of 'index.css' , 'index.js' , 'package.json' and 'Readme.md'.
And similarly delete all the files of public instead of 'index.html'.
